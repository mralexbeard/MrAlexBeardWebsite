      Life constantly presents us with a myriad of problems to be solved on a
      daily basis, some much more taxing emotionally, spiritually, or
      financially than others. Frequently we are forced to make snap judgements
      in the face of difficult or pressing concerns. How we approach our issues,
      or the lack of approach, can create a devastating impact on an
      individual’s psyche, familial or team relationships, and life trajectory.
      If you or someone you know has ever felt "stuck" or buried by problems,
      Alex can help by workshopping techniques and running exercises designed to
      alter a person’s thought process, and see the problems for what they
      really are-opportunities.

      Often, we are our own worst critic. When we make mistakes, we tend to
      relive those moments in our minds. By nitpicking on our past
      transgressions, failures, or flaws, we create negative thought loops.  We
      do this in the hope that the next time we are presented with the same
      problem we will respond differently. Recognizing these thought loops as an
      ineffective means to problem solving will clear a path for successful
      situation analysis, future threat matrix building, and personal growth.
      Everyone’s a critic, let Alex teach you how to filter out your own worst
      enemy.

      In life, and in improv, the only person we have control over is ourselves.
      Don't let past transgressions, poor decision making, or lack of leadership
      permanently alter a person’s view of your character. Time is of the
      essence, learn how to show your tenacity and commitment for positive
      change today!

      People who say, "some things never change" have never explored the power
      of improv. By teaching improv's key tenets of open and active listening,
      acceptance, and agreement everyone has the power to be a more effective
      leader. Laugh, let off the reigns, and promote equitable change both at
      home and in the workplace. Remember: if we listen to act, we have failed
      to listen to understand.
