      Life constantly presents us with a myriad of problems to be solved on a
      daily basis, some much more taxing emotionally, spiritually, or
      financially than others. Ready or not, decisions have to be made
      regardless of how tough they are to make. How we approach our issues, or
      the lack of approach, can create a devastating impact on an individuals
      psyche, familial or team relationships, and ultimately life trajectory. If
      you or someone you know has ever felt "stuck" or buried by problems, Alex
      can help through techniques and exercises designed to alter a persons
      thought process, and see the problems for what they really are,
      opportunities.

      Alex knows all too well the power of negative thought. While on the
      surface it may seem helpful to nitpick at ones past transgressions,
      failures, or flaws as a way to improve for the future, doting on the issue
      can have the opposite effect. Recognizing these thoughts as inaccurate
      fallacies of the mind, planted by societal norms and cognitive distortions
      can lead to more appropriate methods of performance analysis. Everyone's a
      critic, let Alex teach you how to filter out your own worst enemy.

      In life, and in improv, the only person we have control over is ourselves.
      Don't let past transgressions, poor decision making, or lack of leadership
      permanently alter a persons view of your character. Time is of the
      essence, learn how to show your tenacity and commitment for positive
      change today!

      People who say, "some things never change" have never explored the power
      of improv. By teaching improv's key tenets of open active listening,
      acceptance, and agreement everyone has the power to laugh, let off the
      reigns, and promote equitable change both at home and in the workplace.
      Remember: if we listen to act, we have failed to listen to understand.
