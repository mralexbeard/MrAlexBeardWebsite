      Life constantly presents us with a myriad of problems to be solved on a
      daily basis, some much more taxing emotionally, spiritually, or
      financially than others. Ready or not, decisions have to be made
      regardless of how tough they are to make. How we approach our issues, or
      the lack of approach, can create a devastating impact on an individuals
      psyche, familial or team relationships, and ultimately life trajectory. If
      you or someone you know has ever felt "stuck" or buried by problems, Alex
      can help through techniques and exercises designed to alter a persons
      thought process, and see the problems for what they really are,
      opportunities.

      Single-origin coffee is coffee grown within a single known geographic
      origin. Sometimes, this is a single farm or a specific collection of beans
      from a single country. The name of the coffee is then usually the place it
      was grown to whatever degree available.

      Sustainable agriculture is farming in sustainable ways based on an
      understanding of ecosystem services, the study of relationships between
      organisms and their environment. What grows where and how it is grown are
      a matter of choice and careful consideration for nature and communities.

      We want to truly empower the communities that bring amazing coffee to you.
      Thatâ€™s why we reinvest 20% of our profits into farms, local businesses and
      schools everywhere our coffee is grown. You can see the communities grow
      and learn more about coffee farming on our blog.
