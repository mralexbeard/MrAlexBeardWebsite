      What is Improvisational Theatre or "Improv" anyway? Improv is the simple
      and innovative act of creating something (words, physical movement, etc.)
      from nothing (no preparation, instructions, or script) onstage via the
      power of listening, agreement, and bold decision making.

      So how can improv help me and my business? Everyday we are thrust into
      situations requiring quick thinking and immediate decision making. Much
      like a playbook, improv can expose a set of innate patterns and skills
      that enable all of us to think on our feet, making the most informed
      decision for any given problem.
