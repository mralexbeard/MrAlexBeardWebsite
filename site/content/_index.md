      What is Improvisational Theatre or "Improv" anyway? Improv is the simple
      and innovative act of creating something (words, physical movement, etc.)
      from nothing (no preparation, instructions, or script). This is all done
      live onstage through the power of listening, body language recognition,
      agreement, and bold decision making.

      So how can improv help me and my business? Every day, we are thrust into
      situations that require quick thinking and immediate decision making.
      Unfortunately, many of us have innate patterns of logical problem-solving
      that limit our ability to see all of the possible solutions to a single
      problem. Improv can be utilized to expose these flawed patterns, forcing
      us to develop skills of creative collaboration which allows for more
      effective leadership, and most importantly, guiding better decision
      making.

    societal pressure, and impostor syndrome often get in the way of success
    leading to poor decision making and, in turn, poor leadership. Click below
