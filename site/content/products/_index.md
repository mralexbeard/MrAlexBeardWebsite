        The Art of Yes: Improvisation for Volunteer Managers: "The Art of Yes"
        at its core is the mindset of teamwork and collaboration. In life we
        often approach things in black and white terms, "Yes" or "No."
        Subsequently, each choice has a profound impact on the climate of your
        organization and the volunteers that support your mission. Through "The
        Art of Yes" we'll break down the decision-making process and push
        ourselves forward through creativity and spontaneity. Empathy,
        awareness, inclusion, flexibility, authenticity, connection, trust, and
        emotional intelligence are all factors that are explored and enhanced
        through improvisation. Come say “Yes!”

        The Power of Listening - Fostering Equitable Change Through Clear
        Communication: Vanilla Ice got the order wrong when he said, "Stop,
        collaborate, and listen!" Through this workshop you'll learn to stop,
        listen, and then empower through collaboration! We'll explore hands-on
        exercises to demonstrate the importance of active listening i.e.
        "listening to understand,” recognize traps in the change management
        process, and delve into new techniques to foster a previously unheard-of
        level of equity among staff.

        You Don't Have Problems, You Have Opportunities: Each day we are
        confronted with problems at work, at home, and/or in our communities.
        How we approach these moments can make or break relationships and trust,
        but more importantly these moments define our success and personal
        wellbeing. Most of us are not born with the automatic capacity to look
        at issues with a “glass half full” mentality however, with a few key
        exercises we can begin to train ourselves to look at issues and problems
        as what they really are: opportunities. Clear your mind, get creative,
        move your body, laugh, and think outside the box in this hands-on
        workshop where you will learn the skills to break down your problems and
        turn them into opportunities for success.

        Leading the Millennial Workforce: Let's face it...we're all not getting
        any younger! In this workshop you'll learn to stop playing catch-up with
        employment fads and gimmicks in an attempt to attract, relate to, or
        retain today's millennial workforce, and start focusing on what really
        gets their attention...acknowledgment! Through proper action planning
        and communication structure any organization can attract and retain a
        millennial workforce on a shoestring budget. They might LIKE to play
        pinball in the break-room but they NEED to be heard and recognized.
        Disclosure: Alex is a Millennial; Foosball tables and a snack-room are
        NOT required at hosted workshops.
