        The Art of Yes: Improvisation for Volunteer Managers:  "The Art of Yes"
        at its core is the mindset of teamwork and collaboration. In life we
        often approach things in black and white terms, "Yes" or "No."
        Subsequently, each choice has a profound impact on the climate of your
        organization and the volunteers that support your mission. Through "The
        Art of Yes" we'll break down the decision making process and push
        ourselves forward through creativity and spontaneity. Empathy,
        awareness, inclusion, flexibility, authenticity, connection, trust, and
        emotional intelligence are all factors that are explored and enhanced
        through improvisation. Come say “Yes!”

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.

      Alex was great and I loved his energy from day one. He pushed me outside
      my comfort zone and made me address my weaknesses and crutches. I really
      appreciated that.

    quote: >-
      Alex helped me grow as a leader, where there was any inkling of selfdoubt,
      or feelings of being an imposter, I now stand strong knowing I'm here for
      a reason and that people want to listen
