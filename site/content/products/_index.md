        The Art of Yes: Improvisation for Volunteer Managers: "The Art of Yes"
        at its core is the mindset of teamwork and collaboration. In life we
        often approach things in black and white terms, "Yes" or "No."
        Subsequently, each choice has a profound impact on the climate of your
        organization and the volunteers that support your mission. Through "The
        Art of Yes" we'll break down the decision making process and push
        ourselves forward through creativity and spontaneity. Empathy,
        awareness, inclusion, flexibility, authenticity, connection, trust, and
        emotional intelligence are all factors that are explored and enhanced
        through improvisation. Come say “Yes!”

        The Power of Listening - Fostering Equitable Change Through Clear
        Communication: Vanilla Ice got the order wrong when he said, "Stop,
        collaborate, and listen!" Through this workshop you'll learn to stop,
        listen and then empower through collaboration! We'll explore hands-on
        exercises to demonstrate the importance of active listening i.e.
        "listening to understand", recognize traps in the change management
        process, and delve into new techniques to foster a previously unheard of
        level of equity among staff.

        You Don't Have Problems, You Have Opportunities: Each day we are
        confronted problems at work, at home, and/or in our communities. How we
        approach these moments can make or break relationships and trust, but
        more importantly these moments define our success and personal well
        being. Most of us are not born with the innate ability of automatically
        looking at issues with a “glass half full” mentality, but through a few
        key exercises we can begin to train ourselves to look at issues and
        problems as what they really are: opportunities. Clear your mind, get
        creative, move your body, laugh, and think outside the box in this hands
        on workshop where you will learn the skills to break down your problems
        and turn them into opportunities for success.

        catch-up with employment fads in an attempt to attract, relate, or
        retain today's millennial workforce, and start focusing on what really
        gets their attention, acknowledgment.
